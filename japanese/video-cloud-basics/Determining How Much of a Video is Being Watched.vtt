Hi, I'm Bob Bailey, a Learning
Specialist with Brightcove.

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:11.730 align:middle line:84%
In this video, we'll see how to
determine how much of a video

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.860 align:middle line:90%
is being watched.

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.110 align:middle line:84%
The Engagement report
in the Analytics module

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:18.690 align:middle line:84%
is used to view
video engagement.

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.400 align:middle line:84%
While a high number
of video views

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.620 align:middle line:84%
may indicate that
a video is popular,

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:24.630 align:middle line:84%
viewing the video
engagement for a video

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.360 align:middle line:84%
will show viewer
behavior over time.

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.490 align:middle line:84%
Are viewers watching
most of the video

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.300 align:middle line:84%
or are they dropping
off after a few seconds?

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.137 align:middle line:84%
Start by using the date selector
in the upper right of the page

00:00:36.137 --> 00:00:37.845 align:middle line:84%
to select the date
range for your report.

00:00:37.845 --> 00:00:40.960 align:middle line:90%


00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.280 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to select
Last 30 days.

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.910 align:middle line:84%
Next I'll select
the video dimension.

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.130 align:middle line:84%
Click on any of the column
headers to sort the data

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:51.850 align:middle line:90%
by that column.

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:55.350 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to sort
by Views at 1%.

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.490 align:middle line:84%
Click on a video title to look
at the engagement for a video.

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:02.940 align:middle line:84%
This graph will show the
number of views over time.

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.519 align:middle line:84%
Ideally, this line would
go straight across,

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.400 align:middle line:84%
indicating that everyone who
started watching the video

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.010 align:middle line:90%
watched the entire video.

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.130 align:middle line:84%
You may want to investigate
any sudden spikes or drops

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.630 align:middle line:90%
in the engagement graph.

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:19.863 align:middle line:84%
You can click on the graph
and use the preview player

00:01:19.863 --> 00:01:21.155 align:middle line:90%
to view that part of the video.

00:01:21.155 --> 00:01:25.570 align:middle line:90%


00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:28.420 align:middle line:84%
To locate a specific
video, use the search box

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.570 align:middle line:90%
