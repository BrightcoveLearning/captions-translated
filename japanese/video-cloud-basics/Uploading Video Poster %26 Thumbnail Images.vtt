In this video, you'll learn
how to upload a custom poster

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:11.860 align:middle line:84%
or thumbnail image for
one of your videos.

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:14.320 align:middle line:84%
On the Videos page, I'm
going to click on a video

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:16.940 align:middle line:90%
to open the video properties.

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:19.490 align:middle line:84%
The Images section will
display the current poster

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:22.210 align:middle line:90%
and thumbnail images.

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:24.130 align:middle line:84%
When you upload a
video to your account,

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:26.350 align:middle line:84%
Brightcove Campaign
captures an image

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:29.650 align:middle line:84%
from the midpoint of the video
and uses that as the poster

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:31.810 align:middle line:90%
and thumbnail image.

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:33.880 align:middle line:84%
If you don't like the
image that is captured,

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:37.180 align:middle line:84%
you can upload or
capture new images.

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:40.990 align:middle line:84%
Capturing a new image is
covered in another video.

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:46.240 align:middle line:84%
To upload a new image, hover
over the image, click Upload,

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:48.550 align:middle line:84%
and then browse and
select a new image to use.

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:51.120 align:middle line:90%


00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.580 align:middle line:84%
We recommend uploading
high-quality images,

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:58.030 align:middle line:84%
as Brightcove Campaign
will scale them down.

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.790 align:middle line:84%
Note that it may take a minute
for the processing to complete

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:03.150 align:middle line:90%
and images to update.

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:06.000 align:middle line:90%
