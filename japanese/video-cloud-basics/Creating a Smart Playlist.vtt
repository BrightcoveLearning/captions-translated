Hi, I'm Bob Bailey, a learning
specialist with Brightcove.

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:12.930 align:middle line:84%
In this video, we'll see how
to create a smart playlist.

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:14.700 align:middle line:84%
A playlist is a
collection of videos

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.120 align:middle line:84%
that are grouped together in a
particular order for playback

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:20.390 align:middle line:90%
in a Brightcove player.

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:23.990 align:middle line:84%
To create a playlist,
open the Media module.

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:27.260 align:middle line:84%
Some playlists may be displayed
in the side navigation panel.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.380 align:middle line:84%
But to see all the playlists,
click All Playlists

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:33.690 align:middle line:90%
in the side navigation panel.

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.470 align:middle line:84%
To create a new playlist,
click Create Playlist

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:39.470 align:middle line:90%
in the side navigation panel.

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:41.390 align:middle line:84%
I'll start by giving
the playlist a name.

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.010 align:middle line:90%


00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.060 align:middle line:84%
There are two types of
playlists, manual and smart.

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:50.640 align:middle line:84%
In a smart playlist,
videos are assigned

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.600 align:middle line:84%
to the playlist automatically,
based upon video properties.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.940 align:middle line:84%
Manual playlists are
covered in another video.

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:00.940 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to click
on Smart Playlist

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:02.605 align:middle line:90%
and then click Create Playlist.

00:01:02.605 --> 00:01:05.310 align:middle line:90%


00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:07.200 align:middle line:84%
The playlist settings
allow you to specify

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.570 align:middle line:84%
how the videos will
be sorted and how

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:14.380 align:middle line:90%
many videos will be displayed.

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:18.500 align:middle line:84%
Next, I need to configure which
videos will be in the playlist.

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.460 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to create a playlist
for all of my bird videos.

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.760 align:middle line:84%
All of my bird videos
are tagged "birds,"

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:31.370 align:middle line:84%
so I'll select a parameter of
tags and then enter "birds."

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:34.430 align:middle line:90%
When I'm done, I'll click Apply.

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.980 align:middle line:84%
Notice that all my videos
that are tagged with "birds"

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:40.900 align:middle line:84%
are automatically
added to the playlist.

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.980 align:middle line:84%
On the Overview tab, clicking
Show Playlist in Sidebar

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:47.650 align:middle line:84%
will cause the playlist to
display in the side navigation

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:50.800 align:middle line:90%
panel for easy access.

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.930 align:middle line:84%
Now, as new videos
are tagged "birds,"

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:56.020 align:middle line:84%
they will automatically
be added to this playlist.

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.650 align:middle line:84%
Likewise, if the "birds"
tag is removed from a video,

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:03.010 align:middle line:84%
it will be removed from
the birds playlist.

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:07.560 align:middle line:84%
To edit any of the playlist
settings, click Edit Settings.

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.357 align:middle line:90%
