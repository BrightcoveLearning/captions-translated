Hi, I'm Bob Bailey, a learning
specialist with Brightcove.

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:11.970 align:middle line:84%
In this video, we'll see how
to add a user to a Video Cloud

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:13.830 align:middle line:90%
account.

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.900 align:middle line:84%
You may have other people
in your organization

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.700 align:middle line:84%
who will be working
on your online videos.

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:22.230 align:middle line:84%
You can easily give them access
to your Video Cloud account.

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.630 align:middle line:84%
From the Video Cloud
Studio homepage,

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.100 align:middle line:84%
click the Admin menu,
and then User Management.

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.290 align:middle line:84%
You will need to be an
administrator for the account

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:34.270 align:middle line:90%
to access the user settings.

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:37.780 align:middle line:84%
To add a new user,
click Add User.

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:43.290 align:middle line:84%
Enter the email address
and first and last name

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.080 align:middle line:90%
of the new user.

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:51.000 align:middle line:84%
Next, choose the user's role,
standard or administrator.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.590 align:middle line:84%
Standard users will not have
access to the Admin menu.

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.630 align:middle line:84%
You can also turn off
access to one or more

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:58.890 align:middle line:90%
of the Video Cloud modules.

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.790 align:middle line:90%


00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:04.580 align:middle line:84%
After you make your
selections, click Save,

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:06.200 align:middle line:84%
and the new user
will automatically

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.660 align:middle line:84%
receive an email
notice informing them

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:12.290 align:middle line:90%
of their Video Cloud account.

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.340 align:middle line:84%
The bottom of the page
will list all the users.

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.210 align:middle line:84%
For each user, you can see
their role, the modules

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:21.730 align:middle line:84%
they have access to,
and the last time they

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:24.310 align:middle line:90%
logged into Video Cloud Studio.

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:27.730 align:middle line:84%
Note that this is the last
login to Video Cloud Studio.

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:32.100 align:middle line:84%
It is not tied to a specific
Video Cloud account.

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.020 align:middle line:84%
To edit a user,
click on the user

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.240 align:middle line:84%
to display the user
details, make any changes,

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.040 align:middle line:90%

Delete icon next to the user.
