Hi.

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.100 align:middle line:84%
I'm Bob Bailey, a learning
specialist with Brightcove.

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:13.710 align:middle line:84%
In this video, we'll see how to
activate and deactivate videos.

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.290 align:middle line:84%
Let's start by defining
what we mean by activating

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:18.840 align:middle line:90%
a video or an active video.

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.640 align:middle line:84%
A video in an
active state simply

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.120 align:middle line:84%
means it can be played inside
of a Brightcove player.

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.460 align:middle line:84%
A video that is deactivated
cannot be played

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.980 align:middle line:90%
inside of a Brightcove player.

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.590 align:middle line:84%
If I look at the Media
module, active videos

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.030 align:middle line:84%
will have a green eye
icon in the Status field.

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.310 align:middle line:84%
Videos with a black eye
with a line through it

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:42.170 align:middle line:84%
are deactivated and
can't be played.

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.480 align:middle line:84%
If the status field
isn't displayed,

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.490 align:middle line:84%
use the column
selector to turn it on.

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:50.000 align:middle line:90%


00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.930 align:middle line:84%
To deactivate a video, select
it and click More, Deactivate.

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:01.670 align:middle line:84%
To activate a video, select
it and click More, Activate.

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.340 align:middle line:84%
One common question
that we do get,

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:06.470 align:middle line:84%
what if I have a
video in a playlist,

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:09.020 align:middle line:84%
and then that video
is deactivated?

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.750 align:middle line:84%
Will the video still
appear in the playlist?

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.870 align:middle line:84%
Will the video appear
and just not play?

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:18.440 align:middle line:84%
The answer is if a video and
a playlist is deactivated,

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.160 align:middle line:84%
it will not appear
in the playlist.

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:24.008 align:middle line:90%
