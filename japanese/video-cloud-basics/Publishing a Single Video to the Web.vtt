00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:05.880 align:middle line:90%
Hi.

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.740 align:middle line:84%
I'm Bob Bailey, a learning
specialist with Brightcove.

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:10.530 align:middle line:84%
In this video, we'll
see how to publish

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.170 align:middle line:90%
a single video to the web.

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.030 align:middle line:84%
To publish single
videos to the web,

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.220 align:middle line:90%
you'll use the media module.

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.490 align:middle line:84%
To publish a video, click the
checkbox next to the video.

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.800 align:middle line:84%
And then click Publish And
Embed, and then Publish To Web.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.880 align:middle line:84%
On the publishing dialogue, I'll
start by selecting a player.

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.950 align:middle line:84%
This list contains all
the Brightcove players

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:34.610 align:middle line:90%
in my account.

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:36.800 align:middle line:84%
Once I select a player,
the preview player

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.410 align:middle line:84%
will update to reflect
the player I selected.

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.270 align:middle line:84%
The URL below the
preview player can

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.520 align:middle line:84%
be used to quickly preview
the player in a browser.

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.390 align:middle line:84%
You can also generate
a shortened URL.

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.005 align:middle line:84%
Let's do that and then click
the link to preview the video.

00:00:52.005 --> 00:00:58.950 align:middle line:90%


00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:00.950 align:middle line:84%
There are two different
types of publishing code

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:02.480 align:middle line:90%
that are generated.

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.900 align:middle line:84%
The standard option will
display the iframe embed code.

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.690 align:middle line:84%
For publishing
players in HTML pages,

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:11.090 align:middle line:84%
it's recommended that
you select standard

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.660 align:middle line:90%
and use the iframe embed code.

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:17.530 align:middle line:84%
The advanced option will
display the in-page embed code.

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:19.210 align:middle line:84%
In-page is required
when you want

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:22.730 align:middle line:84%
to interact with the
player from the HTML page.

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:24.460 align:middle line:84%
You should also use
the advanced code

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.260 align:middle line:84%
when you're using
the campaign module

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.220 align:middle line:90%
to track viewer engagement.

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.000 align:middle line:90%
