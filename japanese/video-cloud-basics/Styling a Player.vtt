00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:06.210 align:middle line:90%
Hi.

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.310 align:middle line:84%
I'm Bob Bailey, a Learning
Specialist with Brightcove.

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:11.610 align:middle line:84%
In this video, we'll see
how to do some basic styling

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.190 align:middle line:90%
to a Brightcove player.

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.890 align:middle line:84%
To style a player, up
the Players module,

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.370 align:middle line:84%
and then click on the player
name you want to style.

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:22.080 align:middle line:84%
All of the player
properties will appear

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.440 align:middle line:90%
in the left navigation menu.

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:27.560 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to click on Styling.

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.450 align:middle line:84%
As you make changes
to the player,

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:31.370 align:middle line:84%
they will be reflected
in the preview player

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:33.190 align:middle line:90%
here on the right.

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:36.700 align:middle line:84%
I can choose to hide or show
the title and description,

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:41.920 align:middle line:84%
and configure the Play
button shape and position.

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.700 align:middle line:84%
You can also change
the player colors.

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.070 align:middle line:84%
The Play button color controls
the color of the big Play

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.470 align:middle line:84%
button, and the color of
the progress bar that is

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:52.110 align:middle line:90%
displayed as the video plays.

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.500 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to set this to blue.

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.140 align:middle line:84%
Notice the preview
player has updated

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.750 align:middle line:90%
to reflect the color change.

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.850 align:middle line:84%
Once I'm happy with
the player styling,

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.738 align:middle line:84%
I'll publish the
changes to the player.

00:01:05.738 --> 00:01:08.280 align:middle line:84%
It's important to keep in mind
that whenever you make changes

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.950 align:middle line:84%
to a player, the changes
must be published

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.530 align:middle line:84%
before they will appear out
in your published players.

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:18.040 align:middle line:84%
To do that, I'll click
Publish and Embed, and then

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.350 align:middle line:90%
Publish Changes.

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:22.960 align:middle line:84%
After a brief delay, the
changes will appear out

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.990 align:middle line:90%
in Published Players.

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.000 align:middle line:90%
