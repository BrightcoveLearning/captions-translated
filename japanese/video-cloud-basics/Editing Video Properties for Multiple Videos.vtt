Hi.

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.770 align:middle line:84%
I'm Bob Bailey, a learning
specialist with Brightcove.

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:11.520 align:middle line:84%
In this video, we'll see
how to edit video properties

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:13.830 align:middle line:90%
for multiple videos.

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.720 align:middle line:84%
Video properties
for a single video

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:20.430 align:middle line:84%
can easily be changed by
clicking on a video title

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.290 align:middle line:84%
and then editing the property
in the appropriate section.

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:27.420 align:middle line:84%
Now, what if you need to
change the same property

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.280 align:middle line:90%
for multiple videos?

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.830 align:middle line:84%
For example, maybe I
want to tag my bird

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.950 align:middle line:90%
videos with the tag "Birds."

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.870 align:middle line:84%
The Quick Edit feature
in the media module

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.550 align:middle line:84%
makes it easy to change
properties for multiple videos.

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.093 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to select
some bird videos

00:00:43.093 --> 00:00:44.260 align:middle line:90%
by clicking on the checkbox.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.370 align:middle line:90%


00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:52.730 align:middle line:84%
When the videos are selected,
click on the Quick Edit button.

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:56.530 align:middle line:84%
For this example, I want to tag
all these videos with birds.

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.440 align:middle line:84%
So I'll add "Birds" in
the Tags To Add field.

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.950 align:middle line:90%


00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:06.810 align:middle line:84%
To cancel changes made to
a property, click Restore.

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.120 align:middle line:84%
Notice this can also be
used to quickly remove

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:11.610 align:middle line:90%
all tags from these videos.

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.270 align:middle line:84%
You can see the other
properties that can also be set.

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:17.850 align:middle line:84%
Note that when at
least one video has

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.850 align:middle line:84%
values assigned to a
property, edit mixed value

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.650 align:middle line:90%
will be displayed.

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.220 align:middle line:84%
When you're done making
changes, click Save.

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.520 align:middle line:84%
To close the Quick
Edit panel, click the X

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.390 align:middle line:84%
or click the Quick
Edit button again.

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.000 align:middle line:90%
