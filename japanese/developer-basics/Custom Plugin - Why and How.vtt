00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.770 align:middle line:84%
Before creating a custom
plugin, you should

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.960 align:middle line:90%
know why you want to do that.

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.510 align:middle line:84%
The reasons are many,
but two obvious ones will

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:15.400 align:middle line:90%
be discussed in this video.

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.400 align:middle line:84%
First, you want to
add some functionality

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.380 align:middle line:84%
to multiple players
without having

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.390 align:middle line:84%
to copy the same code again and
again into different locations.

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.640 align:middle line:84%
The problem with having the
code in multiple locations

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.390 align:middle line:84%
is, of course, you have to
update it in multiple locations

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.030 align:middle line:84%
if you want or
need to change it.

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.440 align:middle line:84%
Creating the code as a plugin
will spare you this pain.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.080 align:middle line:84%
Another great reason for
creating a custom log-in--

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.030 align:middle line:84%
and this includes if
you are only going

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.860 align:middle line:90%
to use it in one location--

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.790 align:middle line:84%
is a custom code can
become part of the player.

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:50.820 align:middle line:84%
This means you don't have
to have the custom CSS

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.570 align:middle line:84%
and JavaScript on
the actual HTML page

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.120 align:middle line:90%
where the player is used.

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.330 align:middle line:84%
In Studio, you can associate
the code with the player.

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:04.769 align:middle line:84%
And then, it becomes
actually part of the player.

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.530 align:middle line:84%
Once you do this, just
by using the player,

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.960 align:middle line:84%
you're gaining the
enhanced functionality

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.835 align:middle line:90%
the custom plugin provides.

00:01:11.835 --> 00:01:14.750 align:middle line:90%


00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.800 align:middle line:84%
Now that you know you can't
live without custom plugins,

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.990 align:middle line:90%
so how do you build them?

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.390 align:middle line:84%
The following
high-level steps present

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:27.610 align:middle line:84%
a best-practice approach to
creating a custom plugin.

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:31.210 align:middle line:84%
1, write the code for the
enhanced functionality

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:34.360 align:middle line:90%
in one HTML page.

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.780 align:middle line:84%
You will see this is the hard
part of creating a custom

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:40.570 align:middle line:84%
plugin since the
process of converting

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:45.820 align:middle line:84%
working code to a plugin
is quite straightforward.

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:50.890 align:middle line:84%
2, create a new file that
contains just the CSS.

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:53.320 align:middle line:84%
This simply means
copying the CSS

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.320 align:middle line:84%
from the working code
to a separate file that

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.400 align:middle line:90%
has a dot CSS extension.

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:05.410 align:middle line:84%
3, create a new file that
contains the JavaScript.

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:09.370 align:middle line:84%
This process is much like
creating the CSS file,

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:12.850 align:middle line:84%
but there is a change
that needs to be made.

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:16.360 align:middle line:84%
First, copy all the JavaScript
between the script tags,

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.150 align:middle line:90%
and paste it into another file.

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.410 align:middle line:84%
This file should have
a dot JS extension.

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.480 align:middle line:84%
Then, alter the
line of code that

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.710 align:middle line:84%
uses a get player method to
code that defines the plugin.

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:32.750 align:middle line:90%


00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:40.010 align:middle line:84%
4, use the plugin by linking to
the CSS and JavaScript files.

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:46.240 align:middle line:90%


00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:49.345 align:middle line:84%
Then, call the name given
to the custom plugin.

00:02:49.345 --> 00:02:51.990 align:middle line:90%


00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.690 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:56.210 align:middle line:84%
You're now ready to build
your own custom Plugins.

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:59.000 align:middle line:90%
