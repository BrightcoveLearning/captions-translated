Hi, I'm Matt Boles, a learning
specialist with Brightcove.

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:13.260 align:middle line:84%
In this Developer
Basics video, we're

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:18.300 align:middle line:84%
going to prepare to write
code that controls the player.

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.930 align:middle line:84%
We are going to start with the
advanced player implementation

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.140 align:middle line:84%
code that publishes a video
in a Brightcove player.

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.960 align:middle line:84%
We want to put that
in an HTML page

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.500 align:middle line:84%
and prepare to write code
to control the player.

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.850 align:middle line:84%
Paste the code into the
body of an HTML page.

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.480 align:middle line:84%
Next, enter an ID for
this video element.

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.900 align:middle line:84%
This is needed to address
the video object later

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:44.460 align:middle line:90%
in JavaScript.

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.770 align:middle line:84%
Now create a
JavaScript block where

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.370 align:middle line:84%
the actual player development
code will be placed.

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.450 align:middle line:84%
To talk to the video element,
use the getPlayer method.

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:58.260 align:middle line:84%
Here, the ID is used that
was associated earlier

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.150 align:middle line:90%
with the video element.

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:03.240 align:middle line:84%
Create the structure for
an anonymous function

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:07.500 align:middle line:84%
that will be executed once
the player is retrieved.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.900 align:middle line:84%
Next, a JavaScript
variable is created

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.990 align:middle line:84%
that is used in the code
to talk to the player.

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.570 align:middle line:84%
Assign the variable
the "this" keyword,

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.820 align:middle line:90%
which represents the player.

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.060 align:middle line:84%
We have now created a standard
best practice approach

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.730 align:middle line:84%
to prepare for writing actual
code to affect the player.

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:28.000 align:middle line:90%
