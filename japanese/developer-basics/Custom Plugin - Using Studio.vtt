00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:09.390 align:middle line:84%
Once you have a custom plugin
written and the correct CSS

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:12.570 align:middle line:84%
and JavaScript files
created, it's time to use it.

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:13.980 align:middle line:90%
You have two choices--

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.150 align:middle line:84%
implementing the plugin
in Studio or via code.

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.280 align:middle line:84%
The nice thing
about using Studio

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:22.710 align:middle line:84%
is that you need no
other code on the page

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.690 align:middle line:90%
on which the player is used.

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:27.960 align:middle line:84%
What you sacrifice is
easier modification.

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.720 align:middle line:84%
When you implement a
custom plugin in code,

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.270 align:middle line:84%
it's easier to pass
data to the plugin

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.640 align:middle line:84%
than if you implement
it in Studio--

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.310 align:middle line:84%
that is, if the plugin is
written to accept options.

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:45.630 align:middle line:84%
Let's implement a
custom plugin in Studio.

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:48.750 align:middle line:84%
I will go to Studio's
Players module

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.780 align:middle line:84%
and either create a
new player or choose

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:57.090 align:middle line:84%
an existing player in which
to implement the plugin.

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.340 align:middle line:84%
Once in the Players properties,
click on the Plugin section.

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.090 align:middle line:84%
In the UI for plugins, we
will add a custom plugin.

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.990 align:middle line:90%


00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:17.420 align:middle line:84%
For our plugin, we'll provide
a name, JavaScript URL,

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.115 align:middle line:90%
and the CSS URL.

00:01:19.115 --> 00:01:21.750 align:middle line:90%


00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:27.330 align:middle line:84%
This particular custom
plugin uses no options.

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.420 align:middle line:84%
Now click Save,
publish the player,

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.690 align:middle line:84%
and the enhanced
player is ready to go.

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:36.750 align:middle line:84%
Now remember, any time
this player is used,

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.720 align:middle line:84%
it will now contain the
custom plugin's functionality.

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.000 align:middle line:90%
