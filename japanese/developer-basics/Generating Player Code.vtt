00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.370 align:middle line:84%
Hi, I'm Matt Boles, a learning
specialist with Brightcove.

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:12.210 align:middle line:84%
In this Developer
Basics video, we are

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.420 align:middle line:90%
going to generate player code.

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.940 align:middle line:84%
The first thing needed
to do player development

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.130 align:middle line:90%
is obviously a player.

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.690 align:middle line:90%
So let's create one.

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:24.330 align:middle line:84%
In Studio, select
the Players module.

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.870 align:middle line:90%


00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:30.700 align:middle line:90%
Click on the New Player button.

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:33.500 align:middle line:90%
Then, give it a name.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.890 align:middle line:90%
And finally, click Save.

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.230 align:middle line:84%
That's all there is
to creating a player.

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.070 align:middle line:84%
Remember this player can
be used to play any video.

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:45.460 align:middle line:84%
It is not tied to
one specific video.

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.370 align:middle line:84%
The player-to-video
ratio is not one to one.

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:50.590 align:middle line:90%
It is one to many.

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:52.780 align:middle line:84%
Now that we have a
player, we want to publish

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.360 align:middle line:90%
a video using that player.

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.210 align:middle line:90%
Go to the Media module.

00:00:58.210 --> 00:00:59.635 align:middle line:90%
Pick a video to publish.

00:00:59.635 --> 00:01:02.240 align:middle line:90%


00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:08.160 align:middle line:84%
Click the Publish and Embed
button then Web player.

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.940 align:middle line:90%
Choose the player just created.

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:13.970 align:middle line:84%
Click Advanced,
which is the best

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.730 align:middle line:84%
selection for the
implementation code

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:19.130 align:middle line:84%
when doing development
with a player.

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:22.550 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to make
it a fixed size.

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:25.990 align:middle line:90%
Enter the desired width.

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.290 align:middle line:90%
Then, copy the Advanced code.

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:32.970 align:middle line:84%
And now we have a player
we can write code against.

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.458 align:middle line:90%
