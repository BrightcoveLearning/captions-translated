00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.030 align:middle line:84%
Custom plugins can be written
to accept data that customizes

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.910 align:middle line:90%
the plugin's behavior.

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:13.920 align:middle line:84%
As you'll see in
this video, it is

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.690 align:middle line:84%
much like passing data to a
function in normal JavaScript.

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:22.910 align:middle line:84%
Here, you see a
simple custom plugin.

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:25.810 align:middle line:84%
The plugin redirects the
browser to a new page

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:28.480 align:middle line:90%
when the video ends.

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.510 align:middle line:84%
Note that when the page to
which the browser redirects

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:34.240 align:middle line:90%
is passed as a parameter.

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:37.840 align:middle line:84%
The plugin accepts a parameter
in the anonymous function

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.320 align:middle line:90%
where the plugin is defined.

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.920 align:middle line:84%
Convention has it the
object is named "options,"

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.880 align:middle line:90%
but it's not required.

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.400 align:middle line:84%
The properties of the
object passed to the plugin

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.770 align:middle line:90%
can then be used.

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.640 align:middle line:84%
The options.redirectURL
property value

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.950 align:middle line:90%
is used in the redirection.

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:01.570 align:middle line:90%


00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:05.019 align:middle line:84%
On the HTML page where the
custom plugin is called,

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:07.870 align:middle line:84%
we first use
standard code to link

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:10.690 align:middle line:90%
to the plugin's JavaScript.

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:15.850 align:middle line:84%
By the way, there is no CSS
needed for this custom plugin.

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.190 align:middle line:84%
In the script block,
where we place code

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:22.750 align:middle line:84%
to affect the player,
a variable is created.

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:24.620 align:middle line:84%
The variable is
called "options,"

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:29.770 align:middle line:84%
which is a JavaScript Object
that is passed to the plugin.

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:34.870 align:middle line:84%
For this plugin, we only define
one property named redirectURL,

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:39.910 align:middle line:84%
which must match the property
name used in the plugin.

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:42.550 align:middle line:84%
This object contains
only one property,

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:45.490 align:middle line:84%
but the options object can
have as many properties

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.220 align:middle line:90%
as the plugin requires.

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.250 align:middle line:84%
Now when calling the
custom plugin named

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:57.130 align:middle line:84%
navigateOnVideoEnd, you
pass the options object.

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:58.210 align:middle line:90%
That's it for the code.

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:00.880 align:middle line:90%
Let's test to be sure it works.

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.540 align:middle line:84%
We'll browse the HTML page,
and when the video ends,

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:07.600 align:middle line:84%
the redirect takes us
to the page specified

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.550 align:middle line:90%
in the objects property.

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:15.220 align:middle line:84%
Note that you can pass data
to a plugin using Studio.

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.970 align:middle line:84%
Here, you see the configuration
screen for the custom plugin

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:20.620 align:middle line:90%
we have been using.

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.490 align:middle line:84%
To pass data, place
the options object

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:30.280 align:middle line:84%
definition in the Options
parentheses JSON form field.

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.630 align:middle line:84%
Then, when using the player, the
custom plugin's functionality

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:40.000 align:middle line:84%
is part of the player, and you
need no other code on the page

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.900 align:middle line:90%
other than the video tag.

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.000 align:middle line:90%
