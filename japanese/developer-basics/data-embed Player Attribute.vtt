00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:06.130 align:middle line:84%
In this Developer
Basics video, we

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:09.340 align:middle line:84%
are going to gain knowledge
of the little-used or known

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:14.290 align:middle line:84%
data-embed attribute of the
advanced player implementation

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:15.280 align:middle line:90%
code.

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.240 align:middle line:84%
This attribute always appears
in the advanced player code,

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.270 align:middle line:90%
but few understand its purpose.

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:25.930 align:middle line:84%
The data-embed attribute is
very seldom used, and therefore,

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:27.550 align:middle line:90%
not well understood.

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:31.180 align:middle line:84%
The attribute reflects
parent-child relationships

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:32.740 align:middle line:90%
with players.

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:35.200 align:middle line:84%
Imagine if you have
a website and you

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.790 align:middle line:84%
want to have a base player which
influences all other players.

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:43.540 align:middle line:84%
You could set up a parent,
or default, player, then

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:47.710 align:middle line:84%
make children, or
embeds, of that parent.

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:50.320 align:middle line:84%
Changes you make to
the parent player

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.620 align:middle line:84%
will be inherited
by child players.

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:57.190 align:middle line:84%
Child players can
modify inherited changes

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.760 align:middle line:84%
or add more player
configuration.

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.569 align:middle line:84%
Let's look quickly at the
document covering embeds.

00:01:04.569 --> 00:01:06.940 align:middle line:84%
This diagram shows
the inheritance

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:11.380 align:middle line:84%
to the child players, while
one child adds to the player

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.050 align:middle line:84%
and the other child
overrides the shape

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:17.040 align:middle line:90%
of the big Play button.

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.190 align:middle line:84%
The second diagram shows the
poster, the image that it

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:24.030 align:middle line:84%
displayed before the video
plays, is changed from a field

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.070 align:middle line:90%
to a flower in the parent.

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.630 align:middle line:84%
Note that the change is
inherited by both children.

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.820 align:middle line:84%
Lastly, you can
tell if a player is

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.650 align:middle line:84%
a parent or child by the value
for the data-embed attribute.

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.800 align:middle line:84%
If the value of the
attribute is default,

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.540 align:middle line:90%
the player is a parent.

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.830 align:middle line:84%
Note that in player embed speak,
the player can be a parent

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:49.200 align:middle line:90%
but not have any children.

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.040 align:middle line:84%
If the value of
data-embed is not default,

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.970 align:middle line:84%
it reflects the ID
of the parent player.

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.920 align:middle line:84%
Note that the data-player
attribute, the actual player

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.100 align:middle line:90%
ID, is the same in both cases.

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.890 align:middle line:84%
One other insight
into using embeds,

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:13.170 align:middle line:84%
and that is child players
do not appear in Studio.

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.900 align:middle line:84%
If you wish to alter
them in some way,

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:21.930 align:middle line:84%
you must use the player
management API to do so.

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.150 align:middle line:84%
Now you've joined
the select club

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.560 align:middle line:84%
of those who actually
understand the data-embed player

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.410 align:middle line:90%
attribute.

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.000 align:middle line:90%
