00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.870 align:middle line:84%
Hi, I'm Matt Boles, alerting
specialist with Brightcove.

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.960 align:middle line:84%
In this developer
basics video, we're

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.040 align:middle line:84%
going to write code
to autoplay a video.

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:21.280 align:middle line:84%
It might seem we could use
the play method right here

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:22.870 align:middle line:90%
and the video would play.

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:25.810 align:middle line:84%
Actually, this might
work, but we can't write

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:28.340 align:middle line:90%
code that doesn't always work.

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:31.690 align:middle line:84%
The reason this won't work is
we would be asking for problems

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:33.130 align:middle line:90%
with race conditions.

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:36.850 align:middle line:84%
Specifically, we are betting
the video is in the player

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.110 align:middle line:84%
and ready to play before
the play method is executed.

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:44.180 align:middle line:90%
We just can't take that chance.

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.400 align:middle line:84%
So two issues need
to be addressed.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.300 align:middle line:84%
They are, one,
remedy the situation

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:54.040 align:middle line:84%
of a video with an audio
track won't autoplay.

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.980 align:middle line:84%
Number two, be sure
the video is loaded

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:01.930 align:middle line:84%
and ready to be played before
calling the play method.

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:05.770 align:middle line:84%
The muted method is used to be
sure the audio track will not

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:10.930 align:middle line:84%
play, and thus allowing
the video to autoplay.

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:14.110 align:middle line:84%
To be sure the video is
loaded and ready to play

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:18.850 align:middle line:84%
in the player, the loaded
metadata event is used.

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.760 align:middle line:84%
The player will wait
until the loaded metadata

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:24.220 align:middle line:84%
event is dispatched,
which ensures

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:26.230 align:middle line:90%
the video is ready to play.

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:29.740 align:middle line:84%
The on method is used to
add an event listener,

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:34.000 align:middle line:84%
and an anonymous event
handler function is coded.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.510 align:middle line:84%
Now, finally, the play
method can be used,

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:39.050 align:middle line:90%
and we know it will work.

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:40.120 align:middle line:90%
So let's test it.

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:45.280 align:middle line:90%


00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:46.270 align:middle line:90%
Great, it works.

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.000 align:middle line:90%


00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.670 align:middle line:84%
It is vital to
understand the player

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.560 align:middle line:84%
and video are
different entities.

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.950 align:middle line:84%
We must consider
when both of loaded

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.640 align:middle line:90%
and are ready to be used.

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.000 align:middle line:90%
