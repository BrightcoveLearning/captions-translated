00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.220 align:middle line:84%
Since this video is about
converting code that somehow

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.740 align:middle line:84%
enhances the functionality
of Brightcove player

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.090 align:middle line:84%
into a custom plugin, we
need to start with some code.

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:18.060 align:middle line:84%
Although the actual code
functionality is not

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.070 align:middle line:84%
the purpose of the
video, we still

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.100 align:middle line:84%
want to start with
something meaningful--

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.640 align:middle line:84%
in this case, the starting
code adds Reverse and Forward

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.080 align:middle line:90%
buttons to the player.

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.170 align:middle line:84%
In this case, the buttons jump
the current time of the video

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.630 align:middle line:90%
forward or backwards 5 seconds.

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.580 align:middle line:84%
The amount of the jump is,
of course, programmable.

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:42.330 align:middle line:84%
Here, we see the code on one
page that adds the buttons.

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:46.410 align:middle line:84%
In addition to the video tag,
there is CSS and JavaScript

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.040 align:middle line:90%
that adds the functionality.

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.410 align:middle line:84%
First, we'll need
empty files, in which

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.320 align:middle line:84%
to place the CSS and
JavaScript once they are

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.960 align:middle line:90%
moved from the one-page code.

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.970 align:middle line:84%
Now copy the CSS, minus the
style tags, into the CSS file.

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:07.380 align:middle line:84%
Next, grab all the JavaScript
between the script tags

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.020 align:middle line:90%
and put it into the JS file.

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.330 align:middle line:84%
There is one change
we need to make.

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.510 align:middle line:84%
In nearly all code
that alters the player,

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:18.030 align:middle line:84%
there will be a line
that uses the getPlayer

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.340 align:middle line:84%
method, which lets us get a
handle on the video element.

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.740 align:middle line:84%
For a plugin, you
remove that line

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.320 align:middle line:84%
of code, and at the
top of the JavaScript,

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.330 align:middle line:84%
use a code that defines a
Brightcove player plugin.

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.360 align:middle line:84%
This code uses the
registerPlugin method

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.900 align:middle line:84%
and also defines the
name of the plugin.

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.930 align:middle line:84%
Now we need to use the new
files that have been created

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.800 align:middle line:84%
and be sure the
buttons still work.

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.250 align:middle line:84%
We'll remove the style
tags and use a link tag

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.950 align:middle line:90%
to pull in the CSS.

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.270 align:middle line:84%
Next, use a script tag to
pull in the JavaScript.

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:02.160 align:middle line:90%


00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.600 align:middle line:84%
Lastly, alter the script block,
so after we assign the myPlayer

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.789 align:middle line:84%
variable, the
reference to the player

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.430 align:middle line:84%
will call the name
of the plugin, which

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.790 align:middle line:90%
we set to backForwardButtons.

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.800 align:middle line:84%
All right, let's
be sure it works.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.910 align:middle line:84%
We're going to refresh the
page so we get our changes,

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:25.050 align:middle line:84%
play the video, and
yep, it still works.

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:26.600 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:31.000 align:middle line:90%
