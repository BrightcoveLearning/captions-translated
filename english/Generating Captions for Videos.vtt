00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:02.640 align:middle line:84%
Closed captions can be
added to your videos

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:04.530 align:middle line:84%
to provide additional
or interpretive

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:07.500 align:middle line:84%
information to individuals
who wish to access it.

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.230 align:middle line:84%
Captions are necessary so
the deaf and hard of hearing

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.440 align:middle line:84%
can access the audio portion
of video presentations.

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.990 align:middle line:84%
In this video, we'll see how
to automatically generate

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.550 align:middle line:90%
captions for your videos.

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.350 align:middle line:84%
Video Cloud Studio provides
a caption generation feature

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:30.960 align:middle line:84%
to automatically generate
captions for newly

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.690 align:middle line:90%
uploaded or existing videos.

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.790 align:middle line:84%
Please reach out to
your account manager

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.070 align:middle line:90%
to have this feature enabled.

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.540 align:middle line:84%
Let's look at the
ways to generate

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.000 align:middle line:90%
captions for your videos.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.490 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to start
in the upload module.

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:48.150 align:middle line:84%
When a dynamic delivery or a
context aware ingest profile

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:51.060 align:middle line:84%
has been selected, an
auto captioning option

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:52.590 align:middle line:90%
will be displayed.

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.500 align:middle line:90%
Enable it to generate captions.

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.550 align:middle line:84%
Select the language to generate
the captions in, or select auto

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.250 align:middle line:84%
detect to generate captions
in the language spoken

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.840 align:middle line:90%
in the video.

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.630 align:middle line:84%
If a language is not
selected, the video language

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.490 align:middle line:90%
is auto detected.

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.350 align:middle line:84%
Selecting a language
will improve

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.330 align:middle line:84%
the caption file
generation time,

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.200 align:middle line:84%
and may improve
overall accuracy.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.390 align:middle line:84%
The label is displayed
inside the player,

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.180 align:middle line:84%
and allows the viewer
to select a language.

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.440 align:middle line:84%
If no label is supplied, the
language code is displayed.

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.630 align:middle line:90%
When finished, click Done.

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.600 align:middle line:84%
Now, as videos are uploaded,
captions will automatically

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:31.590 align:middle line:90%
be generated.

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.300 align:middle line:90%


00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:38.170 align:middle line:84%
You can also generate captions
using the Media module.

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.170 align:middle line:84%
The first option is to
select one or more videos,

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:43.420 align:middle line:84%
and then click
More, Auto Caption.

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.140 align:middle line:90%


00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.580 align:middle line:84%
You can also go into
the video properties,

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:56.820 align:middle line:84%
locate the text track
section, and click Edit.

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.490 align:middle line:84%
Notice there's an
auto caption option.

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.230 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to select it.

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:08.710 align:middle line:84%
I'll select the language,
and enter a label.

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:11.730 align:middle line:84%
Remember, the label is
displayed inside the player,

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.300 align:middle line:84%
and allows the viewer to
select the caption language.

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:21.170 align:middle line:84%
When I'm done, I'll click Add
Text Track, and then Save.

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.345 align:middle line:84%
The caption generation
process will begin.

00:02:23.345 --> 00:02:26.220 align:middle line:90%


00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.600 align:middle line:84%
A message will appear when the
auto captioning is complete.

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.900 align:middle line:84%
Refresh the page to
see the text tracks.

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.540 align:middle line:84%
In all of these cases, after
the caption files are generated,

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.090 align:middle line:84%
they are automatically
configured

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.180 align:middle line:84%
as part of the video's
text tracks properties.

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.080 align:middle line:84%
Captions will appear immediately
during video playback.

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.810 align:middle line:84%
If you would like to review the
captions before they appear,

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.260 align:middle line:90%
you have two options.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.340 align:middle line:84%
First, you can
deactivate the video.

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.400 align:middle line:84%
Videos that are
deactivated will not play.

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.950 align:middle line:84%
Review the captions, and
when they are approved,

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:03.490 align:middle line:90%
activate the video.

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:06.870 align:middle line:84%
You can also set the
caption status to draft.

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.620 align:middle line:84%
To do this, scroll to
the top of the page,

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:15.860 align:middle line:84%
and click on the CC button
to open the caption editor.

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:18.510 align:middle line:84%
Notice right now the
status is published,

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:22.610 align:middle line:84%
which means these captions
will be displayed.

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:25.975 align:middle line:84%
Click Save Draft to save
the captions as a draft.

00:03:25.975 --> 00:03:34.830 align:middle line:90%


00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:38.550 align:middle line:90%
Notice now this status is draft.

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:40.860 align:middle line:84%
Review and edit the
captions, and then

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:43.455 align:middle line:84%
click Publish Text Track
to publish the captions.

00:03:43.455 --> 00:03:46.150 align:middle line:90%


00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:47.590 align:middle line:90%
One last note.

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:50.350 align:middle line:84%
Third party partners can
also be used to generate

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:52.540 align:middle line:90%
captions for videos.
