00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:07.680 align:middle line:84%
In this Developer
Basics video, we

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.050 align:middle line:84%
are going to take
a close look at all

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.260 align:middle line:84%
the attributes of the
advanced or in-page player

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:15.700 align:middle line:90%
implementation code.

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:18.270 align:middle line:84%
This code is commonly
used, but there

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.890 align:middle line:84%
are a few attributes that almost
no one thoroughly understands.

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.010 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look at the
player code copied from Studio

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.050 align:middle line:90%
that publishes the video.

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.930 align:middle line:84%
The code has been formatted
a bit using best practice

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:33.390 align:middle line:90%
indentation convention.

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.000 align:middle line:84%
First, let's go quickly
through the attributes

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.550 align:middle line:90%
that are commonly understood--

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.020 align:middle line:84%
data-account for
the account number,

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:51.660 align:middle line:84%
data-player for the player ID,
data-video--id for the video ID

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.880 align:middle line:84%
of the video to load in the
player, width and height,

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:01.170 align:middle line:84%
data-playlist-id
for the playlist

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:07.560 align:middle line:84%
ID that will work if the player
is configured to play playlist.

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.710 align:middle line:84%
By the way, if you
have a playlist ID,

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.010 align:middle line:84%
you cannot also
supply a video ID.

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:22.200 align:middle line:84%
An error will result. You can
use the data-playlist-video-id

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.670 align:middle line:90%
with the playlist.

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.760 align:middle line:84%
That attribute lets you
set the initial video

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:28.140 align:middle line:90%
to play in the playlist.

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.170 align:middle line:84%
It lets you pick any
video in the playlist

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.560 align:middle line:84%
to be the initial
video that is played.

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.540 align:middle line:84%
Now we get to look at
some attributes that

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.640 align:middle line:84%
are a little more
interesting, and one

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.910 align:middle line:90%
that is very rarely used.

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:46.020 align:middle line:84%
The controls= the empty
string attribute is a Boolean

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.110 align:middle line:84%
attribute which defines
if the controls should

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.790 align:middle line:90%
be shown in the player or not.

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:55.400 align:middle line:84%
In earlier versions
of the generated code,

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.270 align:middle line:84%
simply the word "controls"
would appear with no equal sign

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.480 align:middle line:90%
and quote quote.

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:03.530 align:middle line:90%
That still works, by the way.

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.550 align:middle line:84%
You can also have
controls="fish,"

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:07.630 align:middle line:90%
and that works.

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.180 align:middle line:84%
You can even say
controls="false,"

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:12.430 align:middle line:90%
and the controls will show up.

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.620 align:middle line:84%
If you don't want the
controls to appear,

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:19.930 align:middle line:84%
simply remove any variation
of that attribute.

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.840 align:middle line:84%
Next on the list of sometimes
misunderstood attributes

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.644 align:middle line:90%
is data-application-id.

00:02:24.644 --> 00:02:27.400 align:middle line:90%


00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.860 align:middle line:90%
This is for use with analytics.

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.760 align:middle line:84%
This attribute lets you use
the same player on multiple web

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.910 align:middle line:84%
pages but get different
player analytics

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.300 align:middle line:90%
data for its use on each page.

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.600 align:middle line:84%
For instance, you could have,
on three different pages,

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:52.120 align:middle line:84%
data-application-id="home," data
application id="contact us,"

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.770 align:middle line:90%
and data-application-id="faqs."

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:02.530 align:middle line:84%
The analytics would be reported
separately for each HTML page,

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.610 align:middle line:84%
even though the same player
is used on all three pages.

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.430 align:middle line:84%
This is very useful
and regularly used

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:12.430 align:middle line:90%
for accurate player analytics.

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.150 align:middle line:84%
The data-embed-attribute is
very seldom used and therefore

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:17.800 align:middle line:90%
not well understood.

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:21.400 align:middle line:84%
The attribute reflects
parent-child relationships

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.140 align:middle line:90%
with players.

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:26.380 align:middle line:84%
That's it, and even probably
more detail than you

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:29.110 align:middle line:84%
wanted to know about the
advanced player implementation

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:30.660 align:middle line:90%
code.

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:32.000 align:middle line:90%
