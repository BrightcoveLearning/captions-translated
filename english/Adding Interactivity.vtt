00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.451 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:03.451 --> 00:00:05.430 align:middle line:90%


00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:07.650 align:middle line:84%
In this video, we'll see
how to add interactivity

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:10.620 align:middle line:90%
to an in-page experience.

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.240 align:middle line:84%
Different types of
interactions can be

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.340 align:middle line:90%
added to an in-page experience.

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.710 align:middle line:84%
In the slide here,
the Animal World link

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.210 align:middle line:84%
in the bottom left
of the player is

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.600 align:middle line:84%
an example of a link that
appears as the video plays.

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.830 align:middle line:84%
The upper right side of the
player is displaying a card.

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.890 align:middle line:84%
In-page experiences also
support companion components.

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:31.830 align:middle line:84%
The difference is that
companion components

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.230 align:middle line:90%
appear outside of the player.

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.930 align:middle line:84%
In this example,
as the video plays,

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.780 align:middle line:84%
an image companion component
is displayed on the right side

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.340 align:middle line:90%
of the player.

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.410 align:middle line:84%
Companion components can be
custom HTML, images, or text.

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.270 align:middle line:84%
In this training,
we're going to focus

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.540 align:middle line:90%
on link and card interactions.

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:52.200 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.380 align:middle line:84%
So how do we add links and
cards to our experience?

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:58.210 align:middle line:84%
You need to start by
selecting a video.

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:00.510 align:middle line:84%
Note that you can choose to
have a link or card appear

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.160 align:middle line:90%
during all of the videos.

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.010 align:middle line:84%
We'll see how to do that
when we get to the hands-on.

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:08.430 align:middle line:84%
Next, you need to
click the Link or Card

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.030 align:middle line:84%
icon in the Actions column
associated with the video.

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.130 align:middle line:84%
Once you do that, you can
configure the properties.

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:18.090 align:middle line:84%
For example, for a link, we
would specify the link text

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.350 align:middle line:90%
in the URL.

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.960 align:middle line:84%
For a card, we'll have things
like the title, description,

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.110 align:middle line:90%
and image to display.

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.630 align:middle line:84%
Then we'll also configure
when these things display

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:28.890 align:middle line:90%
and for how long.

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.600 align:middle line:90%
It's pretty easy.

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.880 align:middle line:84%
Once interactivity has
been added to the video,

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.770 align:middle line:84%
an icon will appear
in the Interactivity

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:37.840 align:middle line:84%
column indicating the
type of interaction

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:39.610 align:middle line:90%
that has been added.

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:42.370 align:middle line:84%
You can see in this example,
it looks like a card has

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:45.160 align:middle line:90%
been added to the chimp video.

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.620 align:middle line:84%
To edit or delete an
interaction, just hover

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:50.350 align:middle line:84%
over the interactivity icon
and then click the pencil

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.130 align:middle line:90%
to edit or trash can to delete.

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.610 align:middle line:84%
Let's add some interactions
to our experience.

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:02.570 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to edit my
experience and then click

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.750 align:middle line:90%
Videos in the left navigation.

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.350 align:middle line:84%
Let's add a link
to the chimp video.

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:12.590 align:middle line:84%
To add interactivity, you
can click on the video title

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.810 align:middle line:84%
and then click
Add Interactivity.

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.660 align:middle line:90%


00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.300 align:middle line:84%
Or on the video list,
click the appropriate icon

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.670 align:middle line:90%
in the Actions column.

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.220 align:middle line:84%
Hovering over the icons
will show you what they do.

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.320 align:middle line:90%


00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:32.550 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to click
on the Link icon.

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.070 align:middle line:84%
Next, we'll configure
the link properties.

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:39.210 align:middle line:84%
I'll add the link
text and link URL.

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:40.808 align:middle line:84%
The playback behavior
is what happens

00:02:40.808 --> 00:02:41.850 align:middle line:90%
when the link is clicked.

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.980 align:middle line:90%


00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.050 align:middle line:84%
Next, I'll click on
the Configure link.

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:52.060 align:middle line:84%
This is where we set when the
link appears and for how long.

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.570 align:middle line:84%
You can use exact times
or use percentages.

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:57.460 align:middle line:84%
The slider below
the player can also

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:00.735 align:middle line:84%
be used to configure the
start time and duration.

00:03:00.735 --> 00:03:02.110 align:middle line:84%
Right now, it
looks like it's set

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:03.940 align:middle line:84%
to appear at the
five-second point

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.800 align:middle line:90%
and last for five seconds.

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.490 align:middle line:84%
Notice there is an option to
apply this interaction to all

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:12.860 align:middle line:90%
the videos in the experience.

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.520 align:middle line:84%
Finally, I'll click
Design and decide where

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:17.320 align:middle line:90%
I want the link to appear.

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:21.550 align:middle line:84%
Let's do the bottom left
corner of the player.

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:24.760 align:middle line:90%
When I'm done, I'll click Save.

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.970 align:middle line:84%
This dialog will list all the
interactions on this video,

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:30.670 align:middle line:84%
and can also be used to
edit or delete interactions.

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:33.640 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to close it.

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:36.070 align:middle line:84%
Notice now there's a Link
icon in the Interactivity

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:39.130 align:middle line:90%
column for the chimp video.

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:42.400 align:middle line:84%
Let's add a card to
the elephant video.

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.480 align:middle line:84%
I'll click the Card icon
next to the elephant video.

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.340 align:middle line:84%
It's pretty much the same
process when adding a card.

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:52.670 align:middle line:84%
However, the properties
will be different.

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:55.030 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to browse and
select an image for the card.

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:58.120 align:middle line:90%


00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:01.570 align:middle line:84%
Notice as I start to configure
the card, I can see a preview.

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:07.320 align:middle line:90%


00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:11.070 align:middle line:84%
You can see how these fields
are being laid out on the card.

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:12.810 align:middle line:84%
The playback behavior
is what happens

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:14.680 align:middle line:90%
when the link is clicked.

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.850 align:middle line:84%
I can configure the video to
pause when the card is opened

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:22.470 align:middle line:84%
or have the video pause when the
link and the card is clicked.

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:25.930 align:middle line:84%
Next, I'll click on
the Configure link.

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:29.268 align:middle line:84%
This is where we set when the
card appears and for how long.

00:04:29.268 --> 00:04:30.810 align:middle line:84%
These parameters
are the same as they

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:33.300 align:middle line:90%
were for the link we set up.

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.295 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to select Show
for the entire video.

00:04:35.295 --> 00:04:38.060 align:middle line:90%


00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:40.760 align:middle line:90%
When I'm done, I'll click Save.

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:45.140 align:middle line:84%
You can see the video now
has a card interaction.

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:46.970 align:middle line:84%
When I go back to
the Videos page,

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:50.660 align:middle line:84%
I can see that now we have
a link and card configured.

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:52.850 align:middle line:84%
To edit or delete any
of these interactions,

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:54.080 align:middle line:90%
just hover over the icon.

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.500 align:middle line:90%


00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:58.960 align:middle line:90%
Let's preview the experience.

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:04.790 align:middle line:90%


00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:10.065 align:middle line:84%
When I play the chimp
video, after five seconds

00:05:10.065 --> 00:05:10.940 align:middle line:90%
the link will appear.

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:14.710 align:middle line:90%


00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:19.780 align:middle line:84%
When I play the elephant video,
I can see the card indicator,

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:23.510 align:middle line:84%
and I can click it
to see the card.

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:26.320 align:middle line:84%
Looks like everything
is working.

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:30.630 align:middle line:84%
In the next video, we'll see
how to style the experience.

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:33.000 align:middle line:90%
