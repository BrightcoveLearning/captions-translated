00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.395 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:03.395 --> 00:00:05.302 align:middle line:90%


00:00:05.302 --> 00:00:07.260 align:middle line:84%
Now though we've made a
little bit of progress,

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:11.340 align:middle line:84%
let's talk about previewing
and publishing the experience.

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.980 align:middle line:84%
In-page experiences can
be previewed at any time

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.770 align:middle line:84%
during design to see
how they will appear.

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.450 align:middle line:84%
Previewing is nice
because you can

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:22.710 align:middle line:84%
see the experience without any
of the gallery UI elements.

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.400 align:middle line:84%
To preview an in-page experience
from the Experiences page,

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.700 align:middle line:84%
select an experience
and then click Preview.

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:33.360 align:middle line:84%
Or if you're editing an
experience from the top right

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.210 align:middle line:90%
of any page, click Preview.

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.850 align:middle line:84%
A desktop preview will
open in a new browser tab.

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:42.980 align:middle line:84%
The dropdown list in the
upper left of the page

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.780 align:middle line:84%
can be used to preview the
experience on a desktop,

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.810 align:middle line:90%
tablet, or mobile device.

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:50.930 align:middle line:84%
You can also preview the
before play, playing,

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:52.970 align:middle line:84%
and after-play
experience states.

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:55.690 align:middle line:90%


00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:58.930 align:middle line:84%
When things look good, you
can publish the experience.

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:02.860 align:middle line:84%
To publish an experience, you
need to edit the experience,

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:06.700 align:middle line:84%
click Publish and Embed,
and then click Publish.

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.950 align:middle line:84%
Whenever changes are
made to an experience,

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:10.780 align:middle line:84%
the changes must be
published so they

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.750 align:middle line:90%
appear out on the experience.

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.330 align:middle line:84%
When you publish, embed
code will be generated.

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.000 align:middle line:84%
The embed code is
what is required

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.160 align:middle line:84%
to display the experience
on your website page.

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.680 align:middle line:90%


00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:27.550 align:middle line:84%
Two types of embed code will be
generated, the recommended code

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:30.130 align:middle line:90%
and the no JavaScript version.

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.260 align:middle line:84%
The recommended code should
be used in most cases.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.010 align:middle line:84%
This will display the
experience inside of a div tag

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:37.450 align:middle line:90%
on the page.

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:39.820 align:middle line:84%
This code is required
to allow the experience

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:44.470 align:middle line:84%
to resize itself and
behave in a responsive way.

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:47.290 align:middle line:84%
The no JavaScript code will
display the experience inside

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:49.600 align:middle line:90%
of an iframe tag on the page.

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.450 align:middle line:84%
This should be used when scripts
are not allowed on the page.

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.590 align:middle line:84%
For example, when you're
integrating with a CMS.

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:59.102 align:middle line:84%
A shareable URL will
also be generated.

00:01:59.102 --> 00:02:01.060 align:middle line:84%
This can be shared with
others so that they can

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.670 align:middle line:90%
preview the experience as well.

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.360 align:middle line:84%
Let's go ahead and preview
and publish our experience.

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.759 align:middle line:90%


00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:12.370 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to edit my experience.

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.930 align:middle line:90%


00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.030 align:middle line:84%
Like we said earlier,
previewing allows

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:18.980 align:middle line:84%
you to view the
experience without any

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.530 align:middle line:90%
of the gallery UI components.

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.740 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to click on Preview.

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:28.692 align:middle line:84%
A desktop preview will open
in another browser tab.

00:02:28.692 --> 00:02:30.275 align:middle line:84%
You could see I could
play the videos.

00:02:30.275 --> 00:02:36.410 align:middle line:90%


00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:37.970 align:middle line:84%
The dropdowns in
the upper left can

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:39.740 align:middle line:84%
be used to preview
on a different device

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:43.430 align:middle line:84%
type or a different
experience state.

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:44.960 align:middle line:84%
Let's preview on
a mobile device.

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.550 align:middle line:90%


00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:49.240 align:middle line:90%
Things look good to me.

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:50.760 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to close
the Preview tab.

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.530 align:middle line:90%


00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:56.020 align:middle line:90%
Let's go ahead and publish.

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:01.820 align:middle line:84%
I'll click Publish in Embed
and then click Publish.

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:03.170 align:middle line:90%
This will take a few seconds.

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:09.850 align:middle line:90%


00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:11.770 align:middle line:90%
A couple of things to notice.

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:14.560 align:middle line:84%
The publishing
status is up to date.

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.740 align:middle line:84%
Remember, if you make any
changes to the experience,

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:21.130 align:middle line:84%
those changes do
need to be published.

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:23.560 align:middle line:84%
Notice there's a
shareable URL now.

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.480 align:middle line:84%
I can give this URL
to others so they

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.490 align:middle line:90%
can preview the experience.

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:30.640 align:middle line:90%
We also have embed code now.

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.610 align:middle line:84%
This is the publishing code that
we need to put on our web page

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:37.270 align:middle line:90%
to have the experience display.

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:39.520 align:middle line:84%
One last important
thing to mention.

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:42.190 align:middle line:84%
Once I put this embed
code in my web page,

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:45.940 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't have to be
changed unless I make changes

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.370 align:middle line:90%
to the size of the experience.

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:50.390 align:middle line:90%
That's important to understand.

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:53.380 align:middle line:84%
For example, if I had
components or changed

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:57.710 align:middle line:84%
the videos on this experience,
the embed code will not change.

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:00.490 align:middle line:84%
However, if I go in and
make any changes here

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:04.120 align:middle line:84%
to the layout size, then
the embed code would change,

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:07.210 align:middle line:84%
and I would have to update
the embed code on those pages

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:09.880 align:middle line:90%
where I have this experience.

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:10.540 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:12.970 align:middle line:84%
In the next video, we'll
see how to add interactivity

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:15.390 align:middle line:90%
to an experience.

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:18.000 align:middle line:90%
