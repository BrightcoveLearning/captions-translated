Well, good news.

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.618 align:middle line:84%
You made it to the
end of this training.

00:00:09.618 --> 00:00:11.910 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to just spend a
couple of minutes pointing out

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.910 align:middle line:84%
some additional resources
that will be helpful to you

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.120 align:middle line:84%
as you continue to
work with Gallery.

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:20.370 align:middle line:84%
I highly recommend checking
out the Brightcove Support

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:24.810 align:middle line:84%
Site located at
support.brightcove.com.

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.110 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a quick look
at the support site.

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:31.320 align:middle line:84%
The Support Site is organized
into a series of micro-sites

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.760 align:middle line:90%
for each product or focus area.

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.860 align:middle line:84%
Let's click on the
gallery logo to go

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.260 align:middle line:90%
to the Gallery Documentation.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.320 align:middle line:84%
The Gallery Home Page has
all the links you'll need.

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.960 align:middle line:84%
If you're new to Gallery,
the Getting Started link

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.350 align:middle line:84%
will take you to a page with
some Getting Started resources.

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.380 align:middle line:84%
There are links to the
Step by Step Documents,

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:59.330 align:middle line:84%
Product Overview information
on the Templates.

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:03.950 align:middle line:84%
It links to the online
Training that's available.

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:05.420 align:middle line:84%
The left navigation
could be used

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:07.970 align:middle line:90%
to browse the site categories.

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:12.170 align:middle line:84%
We try to use the categories
to group topics by subject.

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.000 align:middle line:84%
We just saw the Getting
Started section.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.220 align:middle line:84%
The Experiences
section has documents

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.050 align:middle line:90%
organized by experience type.

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:22.620 align:middle line:90%


00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:26.010 align:middle line:84%
The Training section has links
to online training courses

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:29.270 align:middle line:90%
and training videos.

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.168 align:middle line:84%
Finally, the Release
Notes section

00:01:31.168 --> 00:01:33.335 align:middle line:84%
is where you can read about
all the product updates.

00:01:33.335 --> 00:01:36.220 align:middle line:90%


00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.200 align:middle line:84%
All of the support
pages will have a search

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.570 align:middle line:90%
field at the top of the page.

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:44.200 align:middle line:84%
If you know what you're looking
for, just search for it.

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.120 align:middle line:84%
I want to learn more
about Templates,

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:49.390 align:middle line:90%
so that's what I'll search for.

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.000 align:middle line:84%
The Results page should do a
pretty good job of returning

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.980 align:middle line:90%
what you're looking for.

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:55.990 align:middle line:84%
All search results
from the Gallery Site

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:59.990 align:middle line:84%
will display under
This Site tab.

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.370 align:middle line:84%
You can also click on the All
Brightcove Documentation tab

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:06.640 align:middle line:84%

across all the support sites.

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.160 align:middle line:90%
