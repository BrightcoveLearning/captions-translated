The first option is how
the icons are displayed.

I want to see the social icon,
so I'll pick that option.

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.280 align:middle line:84%
Next I need to select which
sharing options are available.

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.520 align:middle line:84%
Some of the sharing options do
offer the ability to configure

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.630 align:middle line:90%
the sharing message.

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.600 align:middle line:84%

Notice the social icons
are also appearing.

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.280 align:middle line:90%
I think we're done.

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.070 align:middle line:90%
There's one last thing to do.

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:26.480 align:middle line:90%
Does anyone know what that is?

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:29.320 align:middle line:90%


00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.720 align:middle line:84%
