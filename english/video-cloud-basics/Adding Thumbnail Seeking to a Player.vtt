00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:04.710 align:middle line:84%
Thumbnail seeking can help
improve the viewer experience

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.670 align:middle line:84%
by displaying video thumbnails
over the player progress bar.

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:10.800 align:middle line:84%
In this video, we'll see
how to add thumbnails

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.390 align:middle line:90%
seeking to a Brightcove player.

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:18.870 align:middle line:90%


00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:22.440 align:middle line:84%
Let's start by
looking at an example.

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:24.960 align:middle line:84%
With thumbnail seeking
enabled, notice

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.810 align:middle line:84%
when I hover over the
progress bar thumbnail images

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.970 align:middle line:84%
will appear showing a
preview of the video

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.270 align:middle line:90%
at that point in time.

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:34.370 align:middle line:84%
This could be helpful
for longer videos

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.610 align:middle line:84%
so viewers can preview a video
and jump to a specific point

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:39.200 align:middle line:90%
in the video.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.780 align:middle line:90%
Let's see how this is done.

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.660 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to open
the player's module,

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.760 align:middle line:90%
and then click on a player name.

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.220 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to click on Controls.

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:53.350 align:middle line:84%
Check the Thumbnail
Seeking option

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:56.020 align:middle line:84%
to have video thumbnails
appear as viewers hover

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:58.690 align:middle line:90%
over the player progress bar.

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:03.530 align:middle line:84%
For new players you create, this
option is enabled by default.

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.950 align:middle line:84%
You will need to enable
this option for any existing

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:07.390 align:middle line:90%
players.

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.360 align:middle line:84%
Remember to publish any
changes made to players.

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.510 align:middle line:90%
A couple of things to mention--

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:16.280 align:middle line:84%
first, the images are
generated dynamically

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.640 align:middle line:84%
the first time the
video is requested,

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.750 align:middle line:84%
and then cached
for repeat viewing.

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.650 align:middle line:84%
Second, images are generated
every 5 seconds for videos

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.220 align:middle line:84%
less than one hour, and every
10 seconds for videos greater

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.250 align:middle line:90%
than an hour.

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:33.620 align:middle line:84%
Finally, thumbnail
seeking will only

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:35.780 align:middle line:84%
work for videos that
have been ingested using

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.720 align:middle line:90%
a dynamic delivery profile.

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.700 align:middle line:84%
In the Media module,
videos that have

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.580 align:middle line:84%
been ingested using a
dynamic delivery profile

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:48.040 align:middle line:84%
will display a green cloud
icon next to the video name.

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.000 align:middle line:90%
