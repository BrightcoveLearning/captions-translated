Hi, I'm Bob Bailey, a learning
specialist with Brightcove.

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:12.540 align:middle line:84%
In this video, we'll see how
to create a manual playlist.

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.640 align:middle line:84%
A playlist is a
collection of videos

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:18.000 align:middle line:84%
that are grouped together in a
particular order for playback

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.130 align:middle line:90%
in a Brightcove player.

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.730 align:middle line:84%
To create a playlist,
open the Media module.

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.150 align:middle line:84%
Some playlists may be displayed
in the side navigation panel

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.970 align:middle line:84%
but to see all playlists,
click All Playlists

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.160 align:middle line:90%
in the side navigation panel.

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.850 align:middle line:84%
To create a new playlist,
click Create Playlist

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.550 align:middle line:90%
in the side navigation panel.

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.300 align:middle line:84%
I'll start by giving
the playlist a name.

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.260 align:middle line:84%
There are two types of
playlists, manual and smart.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.840 align:middle line:84%
In a manual playlist,
you choose the videos

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.660 align:middle line:84%
that are in the playlist
and order them yourself.

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.360 align:middle line:84%
Smart playlists are
covered in another video.

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.770 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to click Manual, and
then click Create playlist.

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.590 align:middle line:90%


00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.050 align:middle line:84%
Clicking Show
Playlist in Sidebar

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:06.630 align:middle line:84%
will cause the playlist to
display in the side navigation

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.200 align:middle line:90%
panel for easy access.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.780 align:middle line:84%
Now, we can add videos
to the playlist.

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:22.710 align:middle line:84%
To do that, I'll go to All
Videos, I'll select the videos,

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.810 align:middle line:84%
and then click More,
Add to Playlist.

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.380 align:middle line:84%
I'll select a playlist
and then click Add.

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.000 align:middle line:90%


00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.720 align:middle line:84%
To change the order of the
videos, select the playlist,

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.435 align:middle line:84%
and then just drag the videos so
they are in the correct order.

00:01:42.435 --> 00:01:45.870 align:middle line:90%


00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:47.850 align:middle line:84%
To remove a video
from the playlist,

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:54.510 align:middle line:84%
select it, and then click Remove
Videos, Remove from playlist.

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:58.940 align:middle line:84%
To edit any of the playlist
settings, click Edit Settings.

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:02.000 align:middle line:90%
