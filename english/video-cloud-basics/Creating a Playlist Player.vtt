[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:09.040 align:middle line:84%
Hi, I'm Bob Bailey, a learning
specialist with Brightcove.

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:13.050 align:middle line:84%
In this video, we'll see how
to create a playlist player.

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:14.880 align:middle line:84%
The benefit of a
playlist player is

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.370 align:middle line:84%
that we can display a
playlist next to the player,

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:21.120 align:middle line:84%
and allow the viewer to select
the videos they want to watch.

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:22.890 align:middle line:84%
The steps to create
a playlist player

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.600 align:middle line:84%
are similar to when creating
a single video player.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.080 align:middle line:84%
However, there are some
additional player settings

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.000 align:middle line:84%
that can be used to
control the appearance

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000 align:middle line:90%
and behavior of the player.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.770 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to create
a new player.

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:40.065 align:middle line:84%
I'll call it Playlist
Player, and click Save.

00:00:40.065 --> 00:00:43.390 align:middle line:90%


00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.820 align:middle line:84%
I'll click on the player
name to open the properties.

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.410 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to change the
player type to playlist,

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:52.780 align:middle line:90%
and then click Save.

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:54.490 align:middle line:84%
Changing the player
type the playlist

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:58.250 align:middle line:84%
will enable some additional
player properties.

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.210 align:middle line:84%
Let's go to the
styling properties.

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:02.710 align:middle line:84%
The playlist type
setting controls

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:05.180 align:middle line:90%
how the playlist is displayed.

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.500 align:middle line:84%
You can choose a horizontal
playlist, vertical playlist,

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.510 align:middle line:90%
or hidden playlist.

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:12.085 align:middle line:84%
Hidden playlists
are typically used

00:01:12.085 --> 00:01:13.960 align:middle line:84%
when you want to loop
through a set of videos

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:19.330 align:middle line:84%
without giving the user control
over which videos to watch.

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:20.980 align:middle line:84%
There are also some
additional playback

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:22.600 align:middle line:84%
properties that
can be configured

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.790 align:middle line:90%
for playlist players.

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:27.850 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to select
Continuous Play Mode, which

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:30.100 align:middle line:84%
will cause the videos
will advance automatically

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.340 align:middle line:90%
and repeat indefinitely.

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.740 align:middle line:84%
I'll also enable
the video countdown.

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:37.600 align:middle line:84%
Once I've made my
selections, I'll

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.740 align:middle line:84%
go ahead and publish the
changes to the player.

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:46.462 align:middle line:90%
