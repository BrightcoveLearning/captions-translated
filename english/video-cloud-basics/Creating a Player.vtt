Hi, I'm Bob Bailey, a learning
specialist with Brightcove.

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:12.270 align:middle line:84%
In this video, we'll see how
to create a Brightcove player.

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:14.340 align:middle line:84%
The Players module
provides an easy to use

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.850 align:middle line:84%
interface for creating
and configuring players.

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.580 align:middle line:84%
To access the Players
module, select Players

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.480 align:middle line:90%
from the navigation menu.

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.070 align:middle line:84%
The body of the
page will display

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:27.110 align:middle line:90%
all the players in the account.

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:30.350 align:middle line:84%
By default, all accounts will
have a Brightcove default

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:32.299 align:middle line:90%
player created.

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:35.150 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times, I'll use
this player for testing.

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:37.860 align:middle line:84%
You're free to use and
style this default player.

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.690 align:middle line:84%
But in this video, I want to
create my own player to use.

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.080 align:middle line:84%
To create a player,
I'll click on Add player

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:50.610 align:middle line:84%
and then give the player a
name and short description.

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.280 align:middle line:84%
It's helpful to add
a short description.

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.082 align:middle line:84%
As you create
additional players,

00:00:55.082 --> 00:00:56.790 align:middle line:84%
the description is a
good way to indicate

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:59.550 align:middle line:84%
where the player is used
or even what features

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.730 align:middle line:90%
are enabled for the player.

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.440 align:middle line:90%
When I'm done, I'll click Save.

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.960 align:middle line:84%
Clicking on a player name will
open the Player Properties

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.900 align:middle line:84%
page where you can see
all the player properties.

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.800 align:middle line:90%


00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.540 align:middle line:84%
To return to the
list of players,

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:18.850 align:middle line:84%
click Back to Players in the
top left corner of the page.

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.000 align:middle line:90%
