In this video, you'll learn
how to capture a custom poster

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.880 align:middle line:84%
or thumbnail image for
one of your videos.

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.490 align:middle line:84%
On the videos page, I'm
going to click on a video

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.010 align:middle line:90%
to open the video properties.

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.710 align:middle line:84%
The images section will
display the current poster

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.080 align:middle line:90%
and thumbnail images.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.180 align:middle line:84%
When you upload a
video to your account,

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.490 align:middle line:84%
Brightcove Campaign
captures an image

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.880 align:middle line:84%
from the midpoint of the video
and uses that as the poster

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.270 align:middle line:90%
and thumbnail image.

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:34.310 align:middle line:84%
If you don't like the
image that is captured,

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:37.940 align:middle line:84%
you can upload or
capture new images.

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.650 align:middle line:84%
Uploading a new image is
covered in another video.

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:47.760 align:middle line:84%
To capture a new
image, play the video

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.330 align:middle line:84%
and then pause it when you get
to the frame you want to use.

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:55.550 align:middle line:84%
When you're on the frame
you like, click capture.

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:57.470 align:middle line:84%
Next you need to select
if this image will be

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:00.760 align:middle line:90%
the poster, thumbnail or both.

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.460 align:middle line:90%
When you're done, click Save.

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.340 align:middle line:84%

for the processing to complete

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.700 align:middle line:90%
and images to update.

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.379 align:middle line:90%
