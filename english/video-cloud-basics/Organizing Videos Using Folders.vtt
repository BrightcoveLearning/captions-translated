Hi, I'm Bob Bailey, a learning
specialist with Brightcove.

00:00:09.038 --> 00:00:10.830 align:middle line:84%
In this video, you'll
learn how to organize

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.380 align:middle line:90%
videos using folders.

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.060 align:middle line:84%
The Media module
offers the ability

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:18.000 align:middle line:84%
to organize videos
using folders.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.920 align:middle line:84%
Having videos in folders
makes them easier

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.630 align:middle line:84%
to manage in accounts
with hundreds

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.850 align:middle line:90%
or thousands of videos.

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.060 align:middle line:84%
Folders are displayed in
the side navigation panel.

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.460 align:middle line:84%
The number after the folder
name indicates how many

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.369 align:middle line:90%
videos are in the folder.

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.760 align:middle line:84%
To create a new folder,
click the Create Folder link

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.830 align:middle line:90%
and enter a name for the folder.

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:41.520 align:middle line:90%
When you're done, press Enter.

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.020 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to create
one more folder.

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.670 align:middle line:90%


00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.030 align:middle line:84%
There are a couple of ways
to add videos to a folder.

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.600 align:middle line:84%
You can select
one or more videos

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:59.180 align:middle line:84%
and then click More, Move to
Folder, select the folder,

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:01.940 align:middle line:90%
and then click Move.

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:04.580 align:middle line:84%
You can also use search
to find videos and then

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.023 align:middle line:90%
add them to a folder.

00:01:07.023 --> 00:01:08.690 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to search
for the bird videos.

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:11.210 align:middle line:90%


00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:17.460 align:middle line:84%
I'll select them all and then
add them to the Birds folder.

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.010 align:middle line:90%


00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:22.980 align:middle line:84%
Note that a video can only
be assigned to one folder,

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:26.580 align:middle line:84%
and nested folders
are not supported.

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.525 align:middle line:84%
Once videos have been
assigned to a folder,

00:01:28.525 --> 00:01:30.150 align:middle line:84%
you can click on the
folder name to see

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.850 align:middle line:90%
the videos in that folder.

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.620 align:middle line:84%
The dropdown menu can be used
to rename or delete a folder.

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:41.500 align:middle line:84%
To remove videos from a folder,
select one or more videos

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:46.060 align:middle line:84%
and click Remove Videos,
Remove Videos from Folder.

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.100 align:middle line:84%
You can also just move
them to another folder.

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.000 align:middle line:90%
