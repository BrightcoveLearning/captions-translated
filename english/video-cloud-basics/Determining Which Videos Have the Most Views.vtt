Hi, I'm Bob Bailey, a Learning
Specialist with Brightcove.

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:11.250 align:middle line:84%
In this video, we'll see
how to determine which

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.980 align:middle line:90%
videos have the most views.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.020 align:middle line:84%
The Performance report
in the Analytics module

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.930 align:middle line:84%
is used to view the
number of video views.

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.070 align:middle line:84%
A video view is counted as soon
as the video begins playback.

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.280 align:middle line:84%
Video views are not useful for
determining how much of a video

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:27.840 align:middle line:90%
a viewer watched.

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.051 align:middle line:84%
The Engagement report
is useful if you're

00:00:30.051 --> 00:00:32.009 align:middle line:84%
interested in determining
how much of the video

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.260 align:middle line:90%
is being watched.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.080 align:middle line:84%
Start by using the date selector
in the upper right of the page

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.990 align:middle line:84%
to select a date
range for your report.

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:44.410 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to select
Last 30 days.

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:47.670 align:middle line:84%
Next, I'll select
the Video Dimension.

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.890 align:middle line:84%
Click on any of the column
headers to sort the data

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.760 align:middle line:90%
by that column.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.328 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to sort
by Video Views.

00:00:55.328 --> 00:00:57.120 align:middle line:84%
This is showing me the
videos with the most

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.040 align:middle line:90%
views for the past 30 days.

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.220 align:middle line:84%
Use the search box to
search for a specific video.

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.490 align:middle line:84%
Video title, video
ID, and reference ID

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:09.350 align:middle line:84%
are common properties
to search on,

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.650 align:middle line:84%
but other properties
can also be searched.

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:14.690 align:middle line:84%
When searching for
a specific video,

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:17.670 align:middle line:84%
it will default to
showing views by player.

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.150 align:middle line:84%
You can also select
other dimensions.

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:22.310 align:middle line:84%
For example, I can
see which countries

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:29.260 align:middle line:84%
had the most views and the
types of devices that were used.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:33.000 align:middle line:90%
