[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:03.992 --> 00:00:05.490 align:middle line:90%


00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.850 align:middle line:84%
In the last video, we saw how
to create and manage playlists.

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:12.360 align:middle line:84%
In this video, we'll see
how to publish a playlist.

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.820 align:middle line:84%
In an earlier video, we
walked through the process

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.860 align:middle line:90%
of publishing a single video.

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:20.490 align:middle line:84%
We selected a video, clicked
Publish and Embed, and then

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.200 align:middle line:90%
Web Player.

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.090 align:middle line:84%
The process to
publish a playlist

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.630 align:middle line:90%
is pretty much the same.

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:27.960 align:middle line:84%
However, there are
some player settings

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.560 align:middle line:84%
you might want to configure when
you are publishing a playlist.

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.540 align:middle line:84%
You could see in the
example on this slide

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.880 align:middle line:84%
here, where we have
published a playlist.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.125 align:middle line:84%
Notice the playlist appears on
the right side of the player.

00:00:40.125 --> 00:00:42.250 align:middle line:84%
There are some player
settings that you're probably

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:45.790 align:middle line:84%
going to want to set when you're
publishing a playlist player.

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:48.280 align:middle line:84%
As part of the player
information properties,

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.920 align:middle line:84%
select a Player
Type of Playlist.

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.070 align:middle line:84%
Once you do that, as part
of the Styling properties,

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:58.660 align:middle line:84%
we can choose a horizontal,
vertical, or hidden playlist.

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:00.940 align:middle line:84%
The playback properties
also have some options

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.520 align:middle line:84%
to randomize the play
order, play the video

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.830 align:middle line:84%
when it's selected,
a continuous play

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:08.290 align:middle line:90%
mode, and a video countdown.

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:11.230 align:middle line:84%
Keep in mind, any time you
make changes to the player

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:14.290 align:middle line:84%
properties, you need to publish
the changes before they will

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:17.050 align:middle line:90%
appear in production players.

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:20.020 align:middle line:84%
Let's go through the process
of publishing a playlist.

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:21.610 align:middle line:84%
What we'll do is
create a new player

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:23.590 align:middle line:84%
that we'll use for
playlists, and then we'll

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.770 align:middle line:90%
publish a playlist.

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:28.440 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to start
in the Players module

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:30.190 align:middle line:84%
and create a new player
that I'll use when

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:32.370 align:middle line:90%
I want to publish a playlist.

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:37.020 align:middle line:84%
I'll call it Playlist
Player and click Save.

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.350 align:middle line:84%
I'll click on the player
name to open the properties.

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.200 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to set the
Player Type to Playlist,

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.120 align:middle line:90%
and then click Save.

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:48.150 align:middle line:90%
Next, I'll go to Styling.

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:52.540 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to select a playlist
type of Vertical Playlist.

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.410 align:middle line:84%
Let's go to the
Playback Properties.

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:59.340 align:middle line:84%
Randomize Play Order will play
the videos in a random order.

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.280 align:middle line:84%
Play Video When Selected will
cause the video to play when

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.660 align:middle line:84%
loaded, even if the previous
video in the player was paused.

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:08.669 align:middle line:84%
Continuous Play mode
will cause the videos

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:12.510 align:middle line:84%
will advance automatically
and repeat indefinitely.

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.770 align:middle line:84%
If Continuous Play
mode is enabled,

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:18.630 align:middle line:84%
you will also have the option
of displaying a video countdown.

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.510 align:middle line:84%
Once I've made my
selections, I'll

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:21.885 align:middle line:84%
go ahead and
publish the changes.

00:02:21.885 --> 00:02:26.675 align:middle line:90%


00:02:26.675 --> 00:02:28.050 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'll go to
the Media module.

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:33.250 align:middle line:90%


00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.410 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to select the
Birds playlist we created

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:40.090 align:middle line:84%
in the last video,
and then click

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.750 align:middle line:90%
Publish and Embed, Web Player.

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:46.840 align:middle line:84%
I'll select the
playlist, Player.

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.740 align:middle line:84%
Now, the preview
window is small,

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:53.560 align:middle line:84%
but if I click on the URL,
I can see the playlist

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:54.505 align:middle line:90%
and play the videos.

00:02:54.505 --> 00:03:01.680 align:middle line:90%


00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.080 align:middle line:90%
That's all there is to it.

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.080 align:middle line:84%
In the next video, we'll look
at some additional resources

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:08.520 align:middle line:84%
that you might
find useful as you

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.180 align:middle line:90%
start working with Video Cloud.

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:14.000 align:middle line:90%
