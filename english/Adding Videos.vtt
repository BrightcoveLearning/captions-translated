[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:05.520 align:middle line:90%


00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.060 align:middle line:84%
In this video, we'll add
videos to our Experience.

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:13.020 align:middle line:84%
To add videos to an in-page
Experience, edit the Experience

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:16.059 align:middle line:84%
and then click Videos
in the left navigation.

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:18.630 align:middle line:90%
Click the Add Videos button.

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.480 align:middle line:84%
The first choice we need
to make is the source.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.990 align:middle line:84%
For in-page Experiences, videos
can reside in a Video Cloud

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.840 align:middle line:90%
account or out on YouTube.

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.220 align:middle line:84%
Note that before YouTube
videos can be used,

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:32.700 align:middle line:84%
you need to configure
the YouTube settings.

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.120 align:middle line:84%
This is done from the Settings
link on the Gallery home page.

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.400 align:middle line:84%
For this training, we're
just going to use videos

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.960 align:middle line:90%
in our Video Cloud account.

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.770 align:middle line:84%
Next, you'll select the
method for adding videos.

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.020 align:middle line:84%
With Select Videos,
you'll manually

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.230 align:middle line:84%
pick and choose the videos
to use in the Experience.

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.230 align:middle line:84%
With Select Playlist,
you'll select a playlist,

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.820 align:middle line:84%
and all the videos
in that playlist

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.220 align:middle line:90%
will be added to the Experience.

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:59.940 align:middle line:84%
With Use Reference ID, you'll
provide a playlist reference

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.250 align:middle line:84%
ID, and all the videos
in that playlist

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.099 align:middle line:90%
will be added to the Experience.

00:01:05.099 --> 00:01:07.230 align:middle line:84%
By using a playlist
reference ID,

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:09.390 align:middle line:84%
the videos in the
Experience can easily

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.610 align:middle line:84%
be changed by
reassigning the reference

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.180 align:middle line:84%
ID to another playlist
using the Media module.

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.145 align:middle line:84%
The Experience doesn't need
to be edited and republished

00:01:18.145 --> 00:01:19.770 align:middle line:84%
when you need to
change the videos that

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.560 align:middle line:90%
appear in the Experience.

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.020 align:middle line:84%
To remove videos,
select the videos,

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.150 align:middle line:84%
and click the Remove
Videos button.

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:30.910 align:middle line:84%
Or if you're using a
playlist or playlist ID,

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:34.770 align:middle line:84%
click the Remove
Playlist button.

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.630 align:middle line:84%
OK, let's look at
how to add videos

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.160 align:middle line:90%
to an in-page Experience.

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.310 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to edit my
Experience and then click

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.460 align:middle line:90%
Videos in the left navigation.

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:51.350 align:middle line:84%
I'll click Add Videos
and then select a source.

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:53.900 align:middle line:84%
Remember, you need to
configure the YouTube settings

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:57.150 align:middle line:84%
before YouTube can
be used as a source.

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:58.820 align:middle line:84%
I also like Video
Cloud to use videos

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.400 align:middle line:90%
in my Video Cloud account.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.800 align:middle line:84%
With the method set
to Select Videos,

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:07.890 align:middle line:84%
I can pick and choose the
videos to add to the Experience.

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.759 align:middle line:84%
This list of videos is
configured to display the 100

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:13.100 align:middle line:90%
most recently updated videos.

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.920 align:middle line:84%
As you page down, more
will be retrieved.

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.730 align:middle line:84%
You can use the Search function
to quickly find videos.

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:25.580 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to select some
videos and then click Add.

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.300 align:middle line:90%
Pretty easy.

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.660 align:middle line:84%
I can click Add Videos
to add more videos

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.840 align:middle line:84%
or select some videos
and remove them.

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.165 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to remove all the
videos and use a playlist.

00:02:35.165 --> 00:02:38.620 align:middle line:90%


00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.740 align:middle line:84%
This time, I'll choose the
Select Playlist option.

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:45.130 align:middle line:84%
This list is configured
to display 20 playlists.

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:48.830 align:middle line:84%
You can use the Search function
to quickly find a playlist.

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:51.880 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to select
the "Animals" playlist.

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.850 align:middle line:84%
Again, I can click Add videos
to select something else

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:58.900 align:middle line:84%
or remove playlists
to remove the videos.

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.000 align:middle line:84%
Hopefully you can see why
earlier we check to make

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.280 align:middle line:90%
sure our content was organized.

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.230 align:middle line:84%
Everything was displaying
in Gallery like I expected.

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.170 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have to
go upload videos

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.240 align:middle line:84%
or organize videos
into playlists

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:13.870 align:middle line:84%
and then come back to add
videos to my Experience.

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.580 align:middle line:84%
Now that we're making some
progress, in the next video,

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:20.340 align:middle line:84%
we'll see how to preview
and publish the Experience.

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.000 align:middle line:90%
