00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.130 align:middle line:84%
In this video, we'll see how
to customize the style of an in

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.410 align:middle line:90%
page experience.

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.660 align:middle line:84%
Styling controls
things like the fonts,

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.800 align:middle line:84%
font sizes and colors
used in an experience.

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.350 align:middle line:84%
To customize the style
of an in page experience,

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.080 align:middle line:84%
edit the experience
and then click style

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.270 align:middle line:90%
in the left navigation.

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:27.030 align:middle line:84%
There are really two options
when it comes to styling.

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:28.980 align:middle line:84%
You can select a
new theme, which

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.840 align:middle line:84%
contains a set of
fonts and colors

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.090 align:middle line:84%
that are applied
to the experience

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.290 align:middle line:84%
or you could change
specific colors and fonts.

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.750 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about themes first.

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.970 align:middle line:84%
A theme is really a
set of colors and fonts

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:45.030 align:middle line:84%
that could be applied to
an experience all at once.

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.010 align:middle line:84%
It's a quick way to
completely change

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.530 align:middle line:90%
the look of your experience.

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.600 align:middle line:84%
Gallery includes a
set of default themes

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.570 align:middle line:84%
and you can create
your own custom themes.

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.450 align:middle line:84%
Once you select the theme,
all of the colors and fonts

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:01.803 align:middle line:84%
in that theme will be
applied to the experience.

00:01:01.803 --> 00:01:03.470 align:middle line:84%
The second option is
to go in and change

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:05.870 align:middle line:84%
the fonts and colors
for individual objects

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:07.970 align:middle line:90%
on the experience.

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:09.980 align:middle line:84%
A list of all the objects
that can be styled

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:12.110 align:middle line:84%
will appear in the
left navigation.

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.300 align:middle line:84%
Locate the object
you want to style

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.030 align:middle line:84%
and then select a new
color, font, or size

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.250 align:middle line:90%
to be applied to the object.

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.680 align:middle line:84%
Let's go ahead and do some
styling to our experience.

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.900 align:middle line:90%


00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:29.890 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to click style
in the left navigation.

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.680 align:middle line:84%
To select a new theme, I'll
click the theme selector

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:35.380 align:middle line:90%
at the top of the page.

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.290 align:middle line:84%
Gallery ships with
light and dark themes.

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:42.580 align:middle line:84%
The account I'm using also has
some custom themes created.

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:45.400 align:middle line:90%
Let's try some of these themes.

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.065 align:middle line:84%
You can see the
styling is updated.

00:01:47.065 --> 00:01:49.840 align:middle line:90%


00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.050 align:middle line:84%
I think I like the
light theme the best.

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:55.390 align:middle line:84%
For information on
creating custom themes,

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:58.210 align:middle line:90%
check the gallery documentation.

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:01.360 align:middle line:84%
To go back to the styling
menu, click the back to styles

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.430 align:middle line:90%
link at the top.

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:06.370 align:middle line:84%
Let's change some
of the styling.

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:08.900 align:middle line:84%
Over here in the left
and the global section,

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:12.070 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to click on the
background color circle.

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:15.790 align:middle line:84%
Let's change the
background color.

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:20.230 align:middle line:84%
Click out of the dialog or
click the X to save the change.

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.980 align:middle line:84%
Any properties that are changed
will display this back arrow.

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.950 align:middle line:84%
You can click on that to go
back to the default value.

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:29.950 align:middle line:84%
Let's change the background
to a lighter color.

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.200 align:middle line:90%


00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.120 align:middle line:84%
If you scroll down,
you could see there are

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.680 align:middle line:90%
a lot of objects listed here.

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.070 align:middle line:84%
One trick that I like
to try is to hover over

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:42.350 align:middle line:90%
an object on the experience.

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:45.110 align:middle line:84%
If a green box appears,
the item to style

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:47.210 align:middle line:84%
will be active in
the styling menu

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:50.090 align:middle line:84%
and the other objects
will be disabled.

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.350 align:middle line:84%
Notice what happens when I
hover over the video info.

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:58.820 align:middle line:84%
Notice the video info section
in the left margin is enabled.

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:02.420 align:middle line:84%
It looks like I can also
style just the title or just

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.830 align:middle line:90%
a description.

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:10.050 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to change the
font and the font size.

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:14.940 align:middle line:90%


00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.233 align:middle line:84%
I also want to change
the color of the overlays

00:03:17.233 --> 00:03:17.900 align:middle line:90%
in the playlist.

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:23.800 align:middle line:90%


00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.540 align:middle line:90%
OK, that's good for now.

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.140 align:middle line:84%
We could spend an hour
just doing styling.

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:31.600 align:middle line:84%
I want to mention
two last things.

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:32.890 align:middle line:90%
To style the player--

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:35.140 align:middle line:84%
for example, the color
of the big play button,

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:37.960 align:middle line:84%
you should use the
players module.

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:39.730 align:middle line:84%
I also want to point
out the tabs here

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:41.260 align:middle line:90%
at the top of the page.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.750 align:middle line:84%
We discussed layout
states earlier.

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:45.700 align:middle line:84%
It is possible to
go in and style

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:49.110 align:middle line:90%
each layout state as well.

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:51.000 align:middle line:84%
In the next video,
we'll talk about some

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.740 align:middle line:84%
of the experience settings
that can be configured.

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:57.133 align:middle line:90%
