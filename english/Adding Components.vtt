00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.465 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:02.465 --> 00:00:05.430 align:middle line:90%


00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.260 align:middle line:84%
Now that we have a new
in-page experience created,

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:10.770 align:middle line:84%
it's time to customize
the experience.

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:14.730 align:middle line:84%
We're going to start by adding
components to the experience.

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.720 align:middle line:84%
To edit an experience, click the
title on the Experiences page.

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.690 align:middle line:84%
Notice the three tabs at
the top of the experience.

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:26.760 align:middle line:84%
These tabs are used to
view the layout states.

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.350 align:middle line:90%
There are three layout states--

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:31.540 align:middle line:84%
Before Play, Playing,
and After Play.

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:33.840 align:middle line:84%
The Before Play status
how the experience

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.320 align:middle line:84%
will appear when first rendered,
before any video playback

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.760 align:middle line:90%
has started.

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.920 align:middle line:84%
The Playing state is how
the experience will appear

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.260 align:middle line:90%
when a video is being played.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.350 align:middle line:84%
Finally, the After Play state
is how the experience will

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.570 align:middle line:90%
appear after a video plays.

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.180 align:middle line:84%
Each one of these states
can be customized.

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.120 align:middle line:84%
To do that, click on one
of the tabs and then just

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.790 align:middle line:90%
start customizing.

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:00.930 align:middle line:84%
OK, let's talk about adding
components to an experience.

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.480 align:middle line:84%
Components can be added
where you see orange plus

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.519 align:middle line:90%
signs on the experience.

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.320 align:middle line:84%
Advertisements, custom,
images, text, and Twitter feeds

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.700 align:middle line:90%
can be added.

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.650 align:middle line:84%
I think most of these
are self-explanatory

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.930 align:middle line:90%
except for custom.

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.750 align:middle line:84%
Custom components are used when
you want to add your own custom

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.200 align:middle line:90%
HTML to the experience.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.180 align:middle line:84%
To add an image
to an experience,

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.700 align:middle line:84%
click the plus sign where
you want to add an image

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.000 align:middle line:84%
and click Image on
the component picker.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.870 align:middle line:84%
Next, configure the
properties for the image.

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:34.620 align:middle line:84%
Notice that you can
also select the layout

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:38.130 align:middle line:84%
states where the
image should appear.

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.830 align:middle line:84%
It's the same process
to add a text component.

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:43.350 align:middle line:84%
Click the plus sign where
you want to add text

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.620 align:middle line:84%
and click Text on
the component picker.

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:52.200 align:middle line:84%
Next, use the rich text editor
to enter and format the text.

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.960 align:middle line:84%
It's pretty easy to edit
or delete a component.

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.435 align:middle line:84%
Just hover over the component
and click the Edit or trashcan

00:01:58.435 --> 00:01:58.935 align:middle line:90%
icon.

00:01:58.935 --> 00:02:01.540 align:middle line:90%


00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:03.900 align:middle line:84%
You can also rearrange
the order of components

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:05.910 align:middle line:84%
or move a component
to a new location

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:08.969 align:middle line:84%
by dragging and dropping the
component in the new location.

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:11.890 align:middle line:90%


00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.033 align:middle line:84%
The last thing I want to point
out, under the Layout menu,

00:02:15.033 --> 00:02:16.450 align:middle line:84%
there are a bunch
of other options

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.480 align:middle line:84%
that can be used to
customize the layout.

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.280 align:middle line:84%
There are a lot of
options for controlling

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.330 align:middle line:84%
the overall presentation and
how the video info, thumbnails,

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.778 align:middle line:90%
and sharing icons will appear.

00:02:27.778 --> 00:02:30.070 align:middle line:84%
We'll see this in a minute
when we get to the hands-on.

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:32.650 align:middle line:90%


00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:38.120 align:middle line:84%
OK, let's go ahead and add some
components to our experience.

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.110 align:middle line:84%
To edit an experience,
you can click on the title

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.180 align:middle line:84%
or select it and then
click the Edit button.

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.690 align:middle line:90%


00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.450 align:middle line:84%
Notice across the top, we have
those layout state tabs that we

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.430 align:middle line:90%
talked about a minute ago.

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.250 align:middle line:84%
Remember, it is possible
to go in and customize

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.235 align:middle line:90%
each one of these states.

00:02:55.235 --> 00:02:57.485 align:middle line:84%
I want to make sure that I'm
on the Before Play state.

00:02:57.485 --> 00:03:00.060 align:middle line:90%


00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.690 align:middle line:84%
Let's start by adding an image
to the top of the experience.

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:09.300 align:middle line:84%
I'll click on the plus icon and
then click the Image component.

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.100 align:middle line:84%
Most of these properties
are pretty straightforward.

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:15.960 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to click on the Browse
link and then browse my machine

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:19.690 align:middle line:90%
and select an image to use.

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:22.470 align:middle line:84%
I also want the image to
display during all three states.

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.020 align:middle line:90%


00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:28.170 align:middle line:90%
When I'm done, I'll click Save.

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.740 align:middle line:84%
Notice the image appears
on the experience.

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:36.040 align:middle line:84%
Let's add some text to
the top of the experience.

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.850 align:middle line:84%
I'll click on the plus
and then click Text.

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:44.410 align:middle line:90%
I'll enter some text here.

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:47.080 align:middle line:84%
You can also use the rich text
editor to change the fonts

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:50.290 align:middle line:90%
and formatting if you want to.

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:53.110 align:middle line:84%
I only want the text to appear
in the Before Play state, which

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:58.040 align:middle line:84%
is the default. When I'm
done, I'll click Save.

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:01.700 align:middle line:84%
Notice the text appears
on the experience.

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:03.125 align:middle line:90%
Let's look at the other states.

00:04:03.125 --> 00:04:06.670 align:middle line:90%


00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:08.530 align:middle line:84%
Notice the image
appears in the Playing

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:11.650 align:middle line:84%
and After Play states
but the text does not,

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:14.050 align:middle line:90%
which is how we configured it.

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:15.760 align:middle line:84%
I'll go back to the
Before Play state.

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:18.540 align:middle line:90%


00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:21.390 align:middle line:84%
Now what if we want to
edit or delete anything?

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:24.810 align:middle line:84%
To edit or delete a component,
just hover over the component

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:28.080 align:middle line:90%
and click Edit or Delete.

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:32.860 align:middle line:84%
You can also edit components
by double-clicking on them.

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:35.860 align:middle line:84%
You can also rearrange
or reorder components.

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:38.850 align:middle line:84%
For example, I can
click on the text

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:44.090 align:middle line:84%
and drag it to the right
side of the experience

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:45.110 align:middle line:90%
and then move it back.

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:48.310 align:middle line:90%


00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:50.320 align:middle line:84%
I could even reorder
the components.

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:54.180 align:middle line:90%


00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:56.430 align:middle line:84%
OK, I think I have
the experience the way

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:58.050 align:middle line:90%
I want it for now.

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:00.450 align:middle line:84%
The last thing I want to
look at are these options

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:02.370 align:middle line:90%
under the Layout menu.

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:04.110 align:middle line:84%
These options really
give us other ways

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:07.800 align:middle line:84%
to customize the layout
of the experience.

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:10.080 align:middle line:84%
If I click on
Presentation, it looks

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:13.500 align:middle line:84%
like I can change how
the playlist appears.

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:15.330 align:middle line:84%
Keep in mind that
all of these options

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:17.850 align:middle line:84%
will change based upon the
template that is selected.

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:20.850 align:middle line:90%


00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:23.430 align:middle line:84%
Video Info will let me
change where the video title

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:24.435 align:middle line:90%
and description appear.

00:05:24.435 --> 00:05:28.550 align:middle line:90%


00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:30.260 align:middle line:84%
Thumbnails will let
me customize how

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:31.850 align:middle line:90%
the thumbnails are displayed.

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:34.830 align:middle line:90%


00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:37.260 align:middle line:84%
Finally, Sharing allows
you to select where

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:38.745 align:middle line:90%
the sharing icons will appear.

00:05:38.745 --> 00:05:43.260 align:middle line:90%


00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.600 align:middle line:90%
OK, this looks good so far.

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:48.240 align:middle line:84%
In the next video, we'll
see how to add video content

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:50.630 align:middle line:90%
to the experience.

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:53.000 align:middle line:90%
